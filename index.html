        <p>
          I am a current Sophomore at West Campus High
          School in Sacramento, CA. I have always been interested in math since I was
          little, and recently became intrigued by engineering and STEM. I have
          competed in a several MESA and Project Invent competitions, which have greatly
          helped me learn and improve on how to problem-solve, collaborate with others,
          and think critically. At West Campus, I attend an engineering class, which has helped
          me build a solid foundation in 3D-printing and designing. In college, I
          hope to major in software engineering, as I aspire to become a software engineer.
